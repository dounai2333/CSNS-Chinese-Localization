[Chinese Readme | 中文说明文档](./README_CN.md)

A localization program that can let CSN:S load the Chinese.

**This project is current under [MIT license](./LICENSE) and written in C++, build with VS2019.**

- Secondary development and issue / pull request are always welcome!

### Important
**The [Season 8 update](https://csol.tiancity.com/homepage/article/2021/01/20/59816.html) updated the Packer file and it break some of my codes, if you use the Packer file after Season 8 update you may hit some problem!**

**Use [this link](http://cdnpatch.csonlinechina.com/CSOUpdate_OBT_CHN210104.exe) to get the old chn Packer file (need a file named "CSOLauncher.exe" then you can use it)**

Due the game crash and Memory Scan program's problem i cannot fix it soon, so use old Packer file instead!

### How to use?
1. Make sure your game language is English
2. Get cstrike_chn.nar from CSO China client
3. Copy it and paste to CSN:S Data folder
4. Rename it to fixtrike.nar or replace cstrike_na_en.nar
5. Get chn_00000.pak* from CSO China client
6. Copy it and paste to CSN:S Data\Packer folder
7. Start the program when Nexon Anti-Cheat* is loading
8. We are done! Enjoy it!

*chn_00000.pak: Don't doubt, you also need other files as this (chn_00001.pak, 00002 etc..)

*Nexon Anti-Cheat: In the lower right of your screen with blue background, showing white text NEXON GAME SECURITY

### Will I be banned for using this on Steam server?
Will, most likely **YES**.

Thats because this program is working like other normal cheating software (memory reading / writing)

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

### Is this program will stop working after game updates?
I'm not sure, I have do it as much as possible to compatible with game update.

But still, you can always download the source code, update the address and build for yourself!
