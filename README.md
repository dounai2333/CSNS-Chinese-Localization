### Will I be banned for using this on Steam server?
Will, most likely **YES**.

Thats because this program is working like other normal cheating software (memory reading / writing)

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

### Is this program will stop working after game updates?
I'm not sure, I have do it as much as possible to compatible with game update.

But still, you can always download the source code, update the address and build for yourself!
